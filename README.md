# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

The demand for buying and selling second-hand is higher than ever. Neighborhood Deals aims to provide its customers with a convenient and cost-effective way to connect with others in their area by providing a platform to post and locate second-hand items and yard sales in their locality. Through our research, we uncovered possibilities to revolutionize the user experience.

* **Competitive analysis** revealed strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for innovation in multiple segments, enabling us to differentiate our product and enhance the user experience.
  * *Basic for sale sites* - Customers expressed the notion of these having an **unappealing layout** and nothing to entice them to use their site over a rival
  * *Yard sale locators* - **Lack of mapping software**, item-specific **filtering**, and user **engagement**
  * *Social media-based platforms* - Sites tend to be **cluttered** with irrelevant listings and ads, making it difficult to easily find targeted yard sale postings.

* **Heuristic evaluation** of the competition revealed opportunities in the aesthetics of the design, error handling and prevention, and innovative features (i.e. routing software)

* **Personas and Scenarios** clarify user needs:
  * **Streamlined** processes with ease of use to provide a **quick experience**
  * **Consolidation of features**: Search, post, and navigation in one app
  * **New features**: Fastest routing to desired yard sale locations
  
* **Sketches and Diagrams** depict the initial concept:
  * **Effortless** walk-through of posting an item or yard sale
  * Steps necessary to **find user-specific yard sales**
  * **Guided fastest route** to visit relevant yard sales
