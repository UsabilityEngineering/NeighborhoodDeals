To demonstrate our wireframe, we have decided to step through two tasks that a user would set out to do. The first being

If the user wants to contact the seller, they select Contact Seller and are brought to a page with a message prompt.

Once the message has been sent, a success screen appears with an option to return to the homepage.

Another option is to click the menu button in the top left had corner which shows a list of options to further interact with the app.
