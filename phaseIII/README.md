## Introduction

The final phase of our app development journey has focused on creating a working prototype and conducting user tests to bring our creation to its full potential. After many hours of ideation, design, and development, we have arrived at a crucial stage that has shaped the final product. Our team has meticulously crafted a prototype that embodies our vision, capturing the essence of the app's functionality and user interface. By observing users in action, listening to their insights, and analyzing their interactions, we aimed to uncover usability issues, uncover hidden opportunities, and refine the app to deliver an exceptional user experience. This final phase marks the culmination of our efforts, as we strive to create an app that interests and captivates our target audience.

## Methods

We conducted a formative assessment involving five participants, observing their completion of five specific tasks while encouraging them to vocalize their thoughts. This process was recorded for later analysis. We followed a written protocol that enabled us to collect consistent data.

#### Background

Participants were asked to describe their approach to selling a used item or listing a yard sale, as well as their process for buying secondhand items. They were also asked to suggest features they'd like in an app facilitating these tasks, and to identify any websites or applications they would typically use.

#### Tasks

As participants carried out each task, we recorded their actions and their success in completing the task. We also asked them to rate the difficulty of each task on a scale of 1 (most difficult) to 5 (easiest).

Task 1: Participants were asked to locate a used antique lamp listing within a 10-mile radius and arrange a purchase meeting with the seller. Metrics: Ability to find the item and communicate with the seller.

Task 2: Participants were asked to identify yard sales within a 10-mile radius using a list view, then navigate to one. Metrics: Ability to use list view to find yard sales.

Task 3: Participants were asked to post a listing for their used antique lamp, priced at $50, with a "Furniture" tag, title, and description, then view the posted listing. Metrics: Ability to post and view the listing.

Task 4: Participants were asked to locate a local yard sale featuring baby items using a map feature, then obtain directions to the yard sale. Metrics: Ability to find directions and navigate the app.

Task 5: Participants were asked to list a yard sale tagged with "Electronics", including their zip code, a title, and a description. They were then asked to view the listed yard sale. Metrics: Correct use of filters and ability to view the posted yard sale.

In wrapping up, we asked the participants about their most and least favorite aspects of the application. We were curious to know if they experienced any troubles while navigating the application and what additional navigation features they might have wanted to see. We also asked them about any other features they would have liked to see in the application. Finally, we invited them to share any other thoughts or comments they had about their experience.


## Findings

After performing five user tests, the results we found were right in line with what we were looking for. Most of the participants were able to navigate through our prototype with ease while completing their tasks with only minor hiccups when a user needed to be reminded of the stipulations of the task. The only suggestion we received about the navigation aspect of our app, was that many of the search pages look the same, such as for searching for a specific item compared to searching for an actual yard sale. The participant mentioned being able to differentiate between each page is important when switching from page to page. 

On the other hand, many of the participants enjoyed the consistency between the different pages of the application, stating that not having to relearn the layout and search strategies provided an easier flow and a faster learning process. 

One aspect of our prototype that most of the participants liked was the ability to add filters to their searches. They mentioned how this streamlines exactly what they are looking for without having to cast a broad net and sift through items that may not be in line with their desired search.

When asked about potential features being added to our application, one of the participants mentioned the ability to link the app with social media would be something they would like to see. Another participant suggested that the ability to compare saved items would allow them to more efficiently find the best deal.



## Conclusions

Performing user tests proved to be an invaluable step in the development of our application, helping us to refine and enhance it in ways that we would have been unable to foresee. Through the tests, we gained firsthand insights into how real users interacted with our app, identifying areas that needed improvement and uncovering unexpected usability issues. The feedback received from users provided a fresh perspective, highlighting aspects that were confusing or unintuitive. By carefully analyzing the results, we were able to identify patterns and common pain points, allowing us to make informed decisions about necessary changes and optimizations. The user tests not only helped us address specific issues but also guided us in making more strategic decisions about the overall user experience. As a result, Neighborhood Deals has undergone significant enhancements and now offers a smoother, more intuitive, and productive user journey. We are grateful for the valuable input provided by the user tests, which played a crucial role in making our app more user-friendly and ultimately enhancing its chances of success in the market.

## Caveats 

While user tests can be immensely valuable, it is important to acknowledge some potential caveats that may arise from them. Firstly, the pool of participants may not fully represent the diversity of the target user base, which can limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, participants in user tests may behave differently from real-world users, knowing that they are being observed or that their feedback will directly impact the development process. This can lead to biased responses or altered behavior. Lastly, user tests may not always uncover all potential issues or edge cases that could arise in real-world scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial to combine user testing with other research methods and iterate continuously to address any limitations and ensure a comprehensive understanding of the user experience.
