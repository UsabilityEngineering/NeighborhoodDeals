# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Neighborhood Deals aims to address the growing demand for sustainable and affordable shopping options by creating a platform that connects buyers with sellers in their local community. By facilitating the exchange of second-hand goods, the app not only promotes the reuse of existing resources but also fosters a sense of community and reduces the environmental impact of traditional retail practices. With features like location-based searches, Neighborhood Deals offers a seamless and trustworthy way for people to find and purchase second-hand items that meet their specific needs and preferences.

## Methods

To gain a thorough understanding of the competition for our website, we used a combination of methods. We conducted online searches to identify competing apps and their features while taking note of what seemed to be working versus what needed to be either changed or updated. 

A competitive analysis was used to determine the strengths and weaknesses of key competitors in our industry, including their products, pricing structures, features, and available platforms. By leveraging these insights, we aim to create a product that provides a superior user experience and sets us apart from our competitors.

We created [personas and scenarios](../personas/personas_and_scenarios.pdf) that helped to understand user needs and motivations, including their goals, pain points, and behaviors when using a second-hand item app. This information was used to create user-centric designs that address specific user needs.

Heuristic evaluation was conducted to assess competing appsâ€™ usability and design against established UX principles and best practices. This helped to identify areas for improvement and provided recommendations for optimizing our app's user experience. Additionally, heuristic evaluation is a relatively quick and cost-effective method that can be performed by expert evaluators or even by non-experts with some training.

We drew UX sketches to communicate design ideas and concepts, providing visual representations of proposed design changes and new features. These sketches were used to provide a visual prototype and to refine the UX design before implementation. We presented these sketches to the software engineering team to help them understand the overall user experience we were looking to achieve.
By using a combination of these research methods, we have gained a comprehensive understanding of the competition and will use that information to support the development of a successful resale marketplace.

## Findings

Based on the results of the competitive analysis, it appears that Nextdoor and Craigslist are the most well-known apps for buying and selling items, but they have their respective limitations. Nextdoor has issues with spam and unwelcoming discourse, while its busy design may be overwhelming for some users. On the other hand, Craigslist has a basic layout that is not specific to yard sales. Among the less-known apps, Yard Sale Treasure Map only focuses on yard sales and lacks item specificity. Garage Sale Tracker, although it has a specific focus on garage sales, has an outdated design and does not provide many results. Overall, there seems to be an opportunity for Neighborhood Deals that combines the strengths of these existing apps while addressing their limitations.

We have identified various demographics that will use Neighborhood Deals by creating [personas](../personas/personas_and_scenarios.pdf). These demographics range from a 34-year-old business professional to a 71-year-old retiree. As a result, the app must cater to users with diverse backgrounds and interests. Our personas' [scenarios](../personas/personas_and_scenarios.pdf) aided us in recognizing the primary concerns that users may have when utilizing the app. The app's crucial features include effortless posting of yard sales or used items, convenient search options for specific items and yard sales, and guidance to nearby yard sales.

During our heuristic evaluation, we discovered that our competitors were deficient in some key areas that we could capitalize on to differentiate ourselves. Firstly, their design aesthetics were not up to par, often lacking unique design features. Secondly, their apps lacked adequate error handling and prevention features, leading to frustrating user experiences. Thirdly, our competitors had no new innovative features that set them apart from the rest of the market. Lastly, their apps were cluttered with excessive advertisements and postings that detracted from the user experience. By focusing on these areas and improving upon them, we believe we can create a superior app that will stand out from the competition.

Drawing two UX sketches aided to visualize and communicate the user experience we were aiming for. They allowed for the ideation of different design solutions and aided in relaying our desired UX design to the software engineers.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
